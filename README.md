# Unsupervised neural networks DIC
Author: Cheng Xn
This code implements an unsupervised learning approach using the U-Net architecture for DIC. The goal is to train a model to predict displacement in images without any labeled training data. The paper has submitted to OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY.

## Dependencies

The code relies on several Python libraries:

- `time`: Used for measuring the execution time.
- `math, random`: General mathematical operations and random number generation.
- `shutil`: Provides functions for file and directory operations.
- `pdb`: Python debugger for debugging purposes.
- `scipy.io`: Library for reading and writing MATLAB files.
- `numpy`: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
- `torch.nn`: Neural network module of PyTorch.
- `torch.optim`: Optimization algorithms for PyTorch.
- `torch.utils.data`: Tools for creating data loaders.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library for visualization.
- `pandas`: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Configuration

The code includes a configuration class `Args_cxn` that holds various parameters for training the model. These parameters include:

- `print_freq`: Frequency of printing training progress.
- `checkpoint_path`: Path to save the model checkpoint.
- `loss_path`: Path to save the training loss.
- `train`: Path to the training data.
- `val`: Path to the validation data.
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
